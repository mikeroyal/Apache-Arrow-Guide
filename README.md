## Reinforcement Learning Learning Resources

[Reinforcement Learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/deep-learning#toc-deep-learn-md_Q_Of3) is a subset of machine learning, which is a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain,though, far from matching its ability. This allows the neural networks to "learn" from a process in which a model learns to become more accurate for performing an action in an environment based on feedback in order to maximize the reward. The Learning can be [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), [semi-supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning) or [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning).

## Rust Learning Resources

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety. Rust has a comparable amount of runtime to C and C++, and has set up its standard library to be amenable towards OS development. Specifically, the standard library is split into two parts: core and std. Core is the lowest-level aspects only, and doesn't include things like allocation, threading, and other higher-level features.

Tock's design centers around protection, both from potentially malicious applications and from device drivers. Tock uses two mechanisms to protect different components of the operating system. First, the kernel and device drivers are written in Rust, a systems programming language that provides compile-time memory safety, type safety and strict aliasing. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel (the scheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific device drivers as well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock uses memory protection units to isolate applications from each other and the kernel.
